### Part 1: Design and design patterns
* What are design patterns?
* Why are they exciting and useful?
* What are some of the caveats of using design patterns?
* How to identify patterns that may be used?
* Design Principles and relationship to design patterns
* Patterns across languages
* C++
* Java/C# (Reflection, Runtime Type Identification)
* Languages with Lambda expressions
* Classifications: creational (OCP), structural (DIP, LSP), behavioral (DIP)
* OCP: Open-Closed Principle
* DIP: Dependency Inversion Principle
* LSP: Liskov's Substitution Principle
* Scope: What is the predominant approach to inheritance vs composition or delegation
* Class-based inheritance plays the vital role
* Object-based composition or delegation plays a vital role
* Lab

### Part 2: Some Creational Patterns
* Abstract Factory
* Builder
* Factor Method
* Difference between Abstract Factor and Factor Method
* Singleton
* Lab

### Part 3: Some Structural and Behavioral Patterns
* Adaptor Pattern
* Composite Pattern
* Decorator Pattern
* Strategy Pattern
* what is one difference between strategy and decorator?
* Strategy allows us to vary the guts whereas decorator allows varying the skin
* Lab

### Part 4: From OO to Functional Implementation
* Influence of Lambda Expressions
* Iterator pattern
* External Iterators
* Internal Iterators
* Objective
* Principle  DIP
* Strategy pattern
* Objective
* Principle
* traditional approach
* lightweight approach
* Lab

### Part 5: Using Functional Composition
* Decorator pattern
* Objective
* Principle
* Combining Functions functional composition
* Using functional composition for decorator pattern
* Lab

### Part 6: Wrapping around Functions
* Cascade Method Pattern
* Creating Fluent interfaces
* Execute Around Method Pattern
* Lab

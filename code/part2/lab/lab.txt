A company has different employees, Staff, Executive, Sales Person, etc. Each one of then travel from time to time and will have to book for their travel.
Each travel includes a flight, car rental, and a hotel accommodation. Depending on the nature of their employment they can book different levels of facilities.
For example,

Staff         Economy Flight Ticket         Economy Car        Three Star Hotel
Executive     First class Flight Ticket     Luxury Car         Five Star Hotel
Sales Person  Business class Flight Ticket  Luxury Car        Three Star Hotel

Design the code so that when a travel is booked, we can query an employee to find the booking details. Please work with the partial code given.
